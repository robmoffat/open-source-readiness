Here is a curated list of some of the best Open-Source Finance projects that [FINOS](https://finos.org) have come across.

Feel free to drop us a PR and we'll mention yours too!

## Libraries

### Finance Database

Are you finding the sheer amount of information on the internet daunting?

[Jeroen Bouma's](https://github.com/JerBouma) hugely popular Python project tries to solve that.

> It features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. It therefore allows you to obtain a broad overview of sectors, industries, types of investments and much more.

### Dash

Dash is the most downloaded, trusted Python framework for building ML & data science web apps.

Built on top of [Plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical Python code. Read our tutorial (proudly crafted ❤️ with Dash itself).

### TA-Lib

This is a Python wrapper for [TA-LIB](http://ta-lib.org) based on Cython instead of SWIG.

> TA-Lib is widely used by trading software developers requiring to perform
> technical analysis of financial market data.
>
> - Includes 150+ indicators such as ADX, MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Bollinger
>   Bands, etc.
> - Candlestick pattern recognition
> - Open-source API for C/C++, Java, Perl, Python and 100% Managed .NET

The original Python bindings included with TA-Lib use [SWIG](http://swig.org) which unfortunately are difficult to install and aren't as efficient as they could be. Therefore this project uses [Cython](https://cython.org) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org) to efficiently and cleanly bind to TA-Lib -- producing results 2-4 times faster than the SWIG interface.

### Alpha Vantage

Alpha Vantage delivers a free API for real time financial data and most used finance indicators in a simple json or pandas format.

This module implements a python interface to the free API provided by [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). It requires a free API key, that can be requested from http://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key. You can have a look at all the API calls available in their [API documentation](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/).
